When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    With a remote repository, I can share my work with others and allow others to contribute to my project. This wouldn't be possible with a locally kept project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might not want my files updated while I'm working on them. Once I finish working on my files, I can then pull changes, and see if any conflicts arise.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks should only be used to make a copy of another user's repository on GitHub's servers. Clones can be used to copy repositories from GitHub servers/locally to the servers/locally. Branches should be used to create copies of your own projects for your personal use.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a local copy of the last known state of the remote allows one to see the latest changes made and merge them into the local copy, even after having made changes to the local copy.
